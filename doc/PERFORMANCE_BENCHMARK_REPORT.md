### Combined Operations Performance

| Operation | Image Size | Format | Native (Rust) | Java (ImageIO) | Speed Improvement | Analysis |
|-----------|------------|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Rotate + Compress | 512x512 | JPEG | 17.68 ms | 18.26 ms | **1.03x faster** | Balanced performance |
| Rotate + Compress | 512x512 | PNG | 15.98 ms | 25.86 ms | **1.62x faster** | Clear native advantage |

- üü¢ **PNG workflows**: Native significantly faster (62% improvement)
- üìâ **Better efficiency**: Single native call vs multiple Java operations
- üéØ **Workflow optimization**: Native combines operations more efficiently

## Performance Analysis by Operation

### 1. Image Rotation - Clear Winner: Native
- **Average speed improvement**: 2-20x faster
- **Best case**: PNG rotation (up to 20x faster)
- **Worst case**: Large JPEG rotation (still 1.65x faster)
- **Recommendation**: Always use native for rotation operations

### 2. JPEG Compression - Quality vs Speed Trade-off
- **For Quality**: Native (mozjpeg) provides superior compression
- **For Speed on Large Images**: Java ImageIO is faster
- **For Small Images**: Native provides both speed and quality
- **Recommendation**: Choose based on priority (quality vs speed)

### 3. PNG Compression - Quality-based vs Basic
- **Native Advantage**: Uses imagequant for quality-based compression with adjustable parameters
- **Java Limitation**: Basic PNG compression without quality control
- **Expected Performance**: Native should provide better compression ratios
- **Recommendation**: Use native for PNG compression when file size matters

### 4. Combined Operations - Native Advantage
- **Balanced performance**: Similar speed with better output quality
- **Workflow efficiency**: Single native call vs multiple Java operations
- **Format Support**: Now includes both JPEG and PNG workflows
- **Recommendation**: Use native for complex image processing workflows

## Technical Insights

### Why Native Excels at Rotation
1. **Optimized algorithms**: Rust image crate uses SIMD and cache-friendly operations
2. **Memory efficiency**: Direct byte manipulation without JVM overhead
3. **No GC pressure**: No garbage collection pauses during processing

### Why JPEG Compression Trade-offs Exist
1. **Algorithm complexity**: mozjpeg uses more sophisticated compression
2. **Quality focus**: Prioritizes compression ratio over speed
3. **Implementation differences**: Different optimization strategies

## Recommendations

### Use Native Library When:
- ‚úÖ Image rotation is required (always faster)
- ‚úÖ High-quality compression is needed
- ‚úÖ Processing small to medium images
- ‚úÖ Combined operations (rotate + compress)
- ‚úÖ Batch processing where quality matters

### Use Java ImageIO When:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Processing very large images quickly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Simple compression with speed priority
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minimal dependencies are required
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Development simplicity is preferred

## Conclusion

The FastImage native library delivers significant performance improvements, especially for image rotation (up to 20x faster) and provides superior compression quality. While Java ImageIO may be faster for large image compression, the native library offers the best overall value for most image processing workflows.

**Overall Recommendation**: Use the FastImage native library as the primary choice, with Java ImageIO as a fallback for specific large-image compression scenarios where speed is critical.
